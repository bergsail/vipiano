There used to be a website displaying a piano keyboard (I forgot the name and
URL). This website would display various chords and scales highlighted on this
piano keyboard. It was really helpful for hobby musicians like myself. But
unfortunately it was coded with Internet Explorer 6 in mind and no longer works
in any browser (because IE6 is dead).

This is my attempt to recreate this very helpful page using nothing but
standards compliant HTML5, CSS2/3 and Javascript.
